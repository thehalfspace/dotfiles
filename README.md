Backup of my configuration files. Mostly for my personal use as and when I migrate to new computer.

### vim: 
1. I use the vim configuration from [amix-ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).
2. The package manager is pathogen. Additional packages: supertab, julia-vim, vimtex.
3. The installation procedure should be same as that of amix/vimrc. The additional modifications should be included automatically. Vimtex is slightly tricky. Additional dependencies such as latexmk, pdf viewer (I use skim) should be installed separately. Please consult the original repositories. 
4. Every plugin is cloned from their repositories into .vim_runtime/my-plugins. I have removed the .git files here, since this is just meant to be a backup. To obtain latest version, clone and pull from the original repo.
